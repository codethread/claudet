A full-stack web application that provides an interactive chat interface for Claude AI, built with Bun, React 19, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **Claude CLI Integration** - Persistent Claude Code session with streaming JSON I/O and dependency injection
- ðŸŽ­ **XState State Machine** - Robust process lifecycle management for Claude CLI
- ðŸ“± **Progressive Web App** - Installable on mobile devices with offline support
- ðŸ”’ **HTTPS Development** - Secure local development with TLS certificates
- ðŸ“² **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive UI with safe area utilities for iOS devices
- âš¡ **Hot Module Reloading** - Fast development with Bun's built-in HMR
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI** - Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS 4
- ðŸŒ“ **Dark Mode** - Light, dark, and system theme support with FOUC prevention
- ðŸ”Œ **WebSocket Streaming** - Real-time log streaming from Claude process
- ðŸ“¦ **Zero Config** - All-in-one Bun runtime (no separate bundler needed)
- ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests with Bun and E2E tests with Playwright

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.2.22 or later
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (for HTTPS certificates)
  ```bash
  brew install mkcert
  ```
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) (for generating PWA icons)
  ```bash
  brew install imagemagick
  ```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd claudet

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Generate certificates and PWA icons
bun run setup
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
bun dev
```

The server will start on `https://0.0.0.0:3000` with:
- âœ… HTTPS enabled (uses self-signed certificates in `./certs/`)
- âœ… QR code displayed in terminal for easy mobile access
- âœ… Hot module reloading for instant updates

Access the app:
- **Desktop:** `https://localhost:3000`
- **Mobile:** Scan the QR code shown in terminal

> **Note:** If you see a certificate error, make sure you've run `bun run setup` to generate the certificates. The `mkcert` tool will install a local CA so your browser trusts the certificates.

### Production

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Run production server
bun start
```

Production builds are output to the `dist/` folder with:
- Minified code
- Source maps
- Optimized assets

## Architecture

For complete details on the project architecture, technology stack, project structure, and development patterns, see the [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md).

**Quick Overview**:
- **Backend**: Bun.serve() with XState 5 state machine managing Claude CLI process
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui with dark mode support
- **Testing**: Bun test runner (unit) + Playwright (E2E) with dependency injection for mocking
- **PWA**: Offline-first with service worker and installable on mobile devices
