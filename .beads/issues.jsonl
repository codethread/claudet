{"id":"claudet-8ot","title":"React Native Expo Mobile Client POC","description":"## Mission\n\nBuild a minimal proof-of-concept React Native mobile app using Expo that connects to the Claudet server to send messages and receive AI replies.\n\n## Scope (minimal POC only)\n\n- Single screen with a text input box\n- Send button to submit a message\n- Display area to show the AI reply\n- No sessions, no history, no settings, no auth\n\n## Workaround\n\nIf Bun and Expo tooling have compatibility issues (Expo CLI often requires Node.js), migrate the mobile project setup to Node.js and npm. The existing server (Bun) stays as-is — only the mobile dev tooling changes. This is expected and fine.\n\n## Server Connection\n\nThe Claudet server exposes POST /api/chat for sending messages. The Expo app should call this endpoint. Note: the server uses HTTPS with self-signed certs in dev — if this causes React Native connection issues, add a plain HTTP option or similar workaround.\n\n## Structure\n\nMobile app lives in mobile/ subdirectory, completely separate from the main Bun project.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"codethread@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-19T07:50:28.202057785Z","created_by":"codethread","updated_at":"2026-02-19T11:57:10.756557732Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T11:57:10.756557732Z","close_reason":"POC complete and working: Expo app connects to server, sends messages, receives replies"}

React Native (Expo) will reject self-signed certs by default, making development painful.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd a secondary HTTP server on a different port (e.g. 3001) that proxies or directly handles /api/chat requests. This is dev-only — prod can stay HTTPS.\n\nAlternatively, if React Native allows insecure HTTP in dev mode (via app.json or Info.plist flags), document that instead.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Keep existing HTTPS server unchanged\n- Only add what's needed for mobile dev connectivity\n- Parent feature: claudet-8ot (React Native Expo Mobile Client POC)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"codethread@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-19T07:50:41.97665186Z","created_by":"codethread","updated_at":"2026-02-19T07:55:41.659717642Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T07:55:41.659717642Z","close_reason":"Added plain HTTP server on port 3001 with /api/chat POST and /api/sessions POST endpoints for mobile client","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"claudet-8ot.2","depends_on_id":"claudet-8ot","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T07:50:41.982574608Z","created_by":"codethread"},{"issue_id":"claudet-8ot.2","depends_on_id":"claudet-8ot.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T07:50:51.147401027Z","created_by":"codethread"}]}
